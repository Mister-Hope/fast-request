# Project-level domain config

This function allows developers to add a domain quickly.

Version required: <Badge text="2023.1.1+"/>

::: caution Suggestion
It is recommended to use project-level domain configï¼Œoriginal config [<ColorIcon icon="tool" /> Setting manager](./settingManager.md) will be used as global config and will have a lower priority than project level config.

The advantage of using project-level config is that when there are many projects, the drop-down box options will be reduced (excluding the config of other projects)

:::

**How to**: Select `application.properties` or `application.yml` in the project, go through the configuration file and click on the icon <ColorIcon icon="restfulFastRequest" />.
