::: caution Suggestion
It is recommended to use [<ColorIcon icon="domainConfig" /> Project-level domain config](../features/projectLevelDomainConfig.md)ï¼Œoriginal config will be used as global config and will have a lower priority than project level config.

The advantage of using project-level config is that when there are many projects, the drop-down box options will be reduced (excluding the config of other projects).

:::

Set up the mapping relationship, Configure the URL prefix address of the corresponding environment under the corresponding project.
