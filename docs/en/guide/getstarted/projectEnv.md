::: danger Suggestion
It is recommended to use [<svg class="icon svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#icon-domainConfig"></use></svg> Project-level domain config](../features/projectLevelDomainConfig.md)ï¼Œoriginal config will be used as global config and will have a lower priority than project level config.

The advantage of using project-level config is that when there are many projects, the drop-down box options will be reduced (excluding the config of other projects).

:::

Set up the mapping relationship, Configure the URL prefix address of the corresponding environment under the corresponding project.
